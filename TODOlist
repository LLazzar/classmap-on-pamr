nbnb TO NTOE in new dat output of vcr.pamr.train with pamr object not pamrcv ADD CHECK

could write vcr.pamr.cv function instead of one
prior and threshold scale could be fited separatly to pamr.predict

optimize mds2??? using only reduced dimension?

check centroid outputted in pamr.predict if diff than train
#should import pamr.predict from pamr package
try removing delta.shrunk an dll that functions

correct stop (halt function9) words words for both functions

maybe not putting both prior and threshold scale (they would influence figparams obtained in train?? prior probably not not considered in computing farness))
also threshhold, changing threhold would mean restimate all the figparamters??? (probably can but in train should go on and compute quantities for all thresholds)

manage threhold.scale and prior additional inputs

for both function decide if data$y should be a factor or not and throw exception (see if pamr can take as input data with data$y as factor)


START FROM LINE 422 USING PAMR.PREDICT TO GET POSTERIORS PROBABILITIES, review also feasible inputs (threshold,prior,figparam)
